After having read the README I find myself more so confused as to how to get into the flow of maneuvering around in github. After some time and a little bit of outside help I managed to finally find myself here editing the original README in order to create a branch for a pull request to submit my response. I finally learned about forking a repo and making it my own repo for editing suggestions. From there I learned about branched and commiting those changes as I am doing currently.. I hope to understand this site better as time goes on but for right now I still have some adjusting to do.
